**GRIPJULY21**

Payment Gateway Integration TASK 3 This is the 3rd task of GRIP July 2021 organized by The Sparks Foundation .There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, PayPal, etc. Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount and other basic information's. I have used Razorpay for payment gateway integration.
